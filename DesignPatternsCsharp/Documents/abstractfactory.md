# Abstract Factory

Examples in the code demonstrates creating document suites (both spreadsheets and word processors) 
for two different platforms: Google and Microsoft. Let's break it down:

Structure:
1. Abstract Product Interfaces:
   - `ISheet` - Interface for spreadsheets
   - `IWord` - Interface for word processors

2. Concrete Products:
   - Google family: `GoogleSheet`, `GoogleDoc`
   - Microsoft family: `MicrosoftExcel`, `MicrosoftWord`

3. Abstract Factory:
   - `ProductCreator` - Abstract class defining creation methods for both product types

4. Concrete Factories:
   - `GoogleProductCreator` - Creates Google suite products
   - `MicrosoftProductCreator` - Creates Microsoft suite products

Usage example:
```
ProductCreator goolge = new GoogleProductCreator();
ProductCreator microsoft = new MicrosoftProductCreator();

IWord googleDoc = goolge.CreateWord();
ISheet excel = microsoft.CreateSheet();
```

## Benefits:

1. Consistency in Product Families
   - Ensures compatible products (e.g., all Google products or all Microsoft products)
   - Prevents mixing incompatible products (can't accidentally mix Google and Microsoft products)

2. Isolation of Concrete Classes
   - Client code works with interfaces/abstract classes
   - Easy to add new product families without changing client code
   - Implementation details are hidden from client code

3. Single Responsibility Principle
   - Each factory handles creation of related products
   - Creation logic is centralized and encapsulated

4. Easy Product Suite Switching
   - Can switch entire product families by changing the concrete factory
   - Client code remains unchanged

## When to Use:

1. System needs to be independent of how its products are created
2. System needs to work with multiple families of related products
3. You want to provide a class library of products while only revealing their interfaces
4. You have strong dependencies between family of related products
5. You want to enforce consistency in product usage

## Limitations:

1. Complexity
   - Can be overkill for simple creation scenarios
   - Adds extra layers of abstraction

2. Rigid Product Family Structure
   - Adding new types of products requires modifying all concrete factories
   - All factories must support all product types

3. Increased Number of Classes
   - Creates many small classes which can make the system harder to understand
   - More files to maintain

4. Fixed Product Sets
   - Once the abstract factory is defined, adding new kinds of products is difficult
   - Requires changes to the base factory interface and all its implementations

## Real-world Use Cases:

1. Cross-platform UI components
2. Database access with multiple providers
3. Document processing systems (like your example)
4. Multiple rendering engines in a game
5. Different styles of GUI components (e.g., Material Design vs. Windows Style)

In the example, the pattern would be particularly useful when:
- You need to ensure document compatibility within a suite
- You want to easily switch between Google and Microsoft implementations
- You need to add more document types (e.g., Presentation) while maintaining family consistency
- You want to hide the complexity of creating related products from the client code
